        In order to lead a healthy life, it is essential to follow a balanced diet. Balanced diet is associated with
        good health, prevention of diseases and recovery from illnesses. A healthy and balanced diet protects against
        malnutrition in all its forms and against all non-communicable diseases too. Eating unhealthy food and lack of
        physical activity are major risk factors for various diseases. There is no one such particular food item that
        can provide entire nutrition to our body for optimum functioning, so in order to have a balanced diet we need to
        have a variety of foods to ensure that we get all the nutrients in optimum quantity. We need different amounts
        of various nutrients at different stages of life to stay healthy and active. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Nutritional requirements are defined by a person's age, sex, body weight and physiological status. So while
        adults need nutrients for ensuring optimal body functions, infants and children need nutrients for growth. Apart
        from this, they need 2-3 times the amount per kg body weight as compared to adults. Pregnancy and lactation also
        demands more nutrients for proper growth of the foetus.

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>Total Time: 30 to 40 minutes</h2>
    Level: Intermediate to advanced <br>
    Equipment Needed: Dumbbells <br>
    What to Expect: Beginners start with no weight or light weights and do one set of 10 to 12 reps of each exercise.
    <br> Experienced exercisers do two to three sets of 8 to 10 reps with enough weight that you can complete the rep
    range feeling as though you would fail if you attempted 2 to 3 more reps (in other words, stop 2 to 3 reps from
    failure).</p>
    
    <p>Warm Up
        Warm up with 5 minutes of light cardio or warm-up versions of each exercise, performing dynamic movements and bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, wall push-ups, and hinges.
        
       <h2> Full Body Workout</h2> 
        To perform a full body workout, choose two upper body exercises, two lower body exercises, and perform the bicycle crunches. You can switch up your exercises each time to form new routines.
